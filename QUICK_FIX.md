# ðŸ”§ Quick Fix Applied

## Issue Fixed
**Error**: `FileNotFoundError: Unable to open file 'emotion_model_best.h5'`

## Solution
Updated model path in both files:

### 1. app.py
```python
MODEL_PATH = os.environ.get('MODEL_PATH', 'trained_models/emotion_model_best.h5')
```

### 2. test_model.py
```python
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('trained_models/emotion_model_best.h5')
```

### 3. Procfile (for Render)
```
web: gunicorn app:app --timeout 120 --workers 1 --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
```

## Why This Happened
Your model files are in the `trained_models/` folder, not the root directory.

## How to Run Now

### Local Development
```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated
venv\Scripts\activate

# Run the app
python app.py
```

### Test the Model
```bash
python test_model.py
```

## For Render Deployment

The app should work now, but if you still see worker timeout:

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Settings"
4. Update "Start Command" to:
   ```
   gunicorn app:app --timeout 120 --workers 1 --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
   ```
5. Save and redeploy

## Verify It Works

After starting the app, you should see:
```
ðŸš€ Starting Facial Expression Recognition Server...
ðŸ“Š Model loaded: trained_models/emotion_model_best.h5
ðŸŽ­ Emotions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, surprise
âœ… Server ready on port 5000
```

Then open: http://localhost:5000

## All Fixed! âœ…

Your app should now work both locally and on Render.
